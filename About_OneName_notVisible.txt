Dear sir/madam,

One of our group member name is not visible in the contributors list. We don't know what was the reason. We tried to find a solution for that. But its not successed. 
We all group members can see that member's name in the contribution list. But cannot see through public. 
But that member also involed during the commiting process. Her commits also visible in commit history.
